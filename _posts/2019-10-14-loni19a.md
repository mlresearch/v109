title: Personalized Push Notifications for News Recommendation
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Push notifications on mobile devices are an important way for users to
  stay up to date with news. Push notifications can also be a major source of annoyance
  for users: being interrupted at the wrong time for something you do not care about
  is frustrating. It is crucial to ensure the right push is sent to the right user
  at the right moment. In this paper we address this problem of personalized push
  notifications. We introduce our streaming push personalization pipeline, describe
  how we personalize pushes, discuss challenges, and end with open questions.'
