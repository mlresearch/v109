title: Optimal Delivery with Budget Constraint in E-Commerce Advertising
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Online advertising in E-commerce platforms provides sellers an opportunity
  to achieve potential audiences with different target goals. Ad serving systems (like
  display and search advertising systems) that assign ads to pages should satisfy
  objectives such as plenty of audience for branding advertisers, clicks or conversions
  for performance-based advertisers, at the same time try to maximize overall revenue
  of the platform. In this paper, we propose an approach based on linear programming
  subjects to constraints in order to optimize the revenue and improve different performance
  goals simultaneously. We have validated our algorithm by implementing an offline
  simulation system in Alibaba E-commerce platform and running the auctions from online
  requests which takes system performance, ranking and pricing schemas into account.
  We have also compared our algorithm with related work, and the results show that
  our algorithm can effectively improve campaign performance and revenue of the platform.
